### Code Organization

#### Folder Structure

![Backend Folder Structure][folderStructureScreenshot]

1. Contexts
   > Contains `classes` used to query and save instances of our `entities`
2. Controllers
   > Contains our `API`s that receive requests from users and finally send back the responses.
3. DTOs
   > Contains `classes` for defining `Data Transfer Objects` (DTOs) used to define how the data will be sent over the network.
   >
   > [Data Transfer Object][dtoDocs] - is an object that carries data between processes.
4. Migrations
   > Contains code generated by `Entity Framework` and provides a way to keep the `database schema` in sync with our `data model`.
   >
   > Details on migrations reference can be found [here][migrationDetails].
5. Models
   > Contains `classes` to be mapped to SQL database tables.
6. Services
   > Contains `classes` and `interfaces` which are used to implement the business logic.
   >
   > This is where the magic happens.
7. Utils
   > Where we store our utility `classes` like Constants (system wide constants), Mapper Profile and more.

- [RTK & RTK Query][rtkDocs]

### Code Organization

#### Folder Structure

![Frontend Folder Structure][frontendFolderStructure]

1. Components
   > Defines all the `common` UI components that can be used in any page.
2. Constants
   > Defines constant data like key words, `api tags` and more.
3. Features
   > Defines files that will change the different `api requests` to functions that can be imported when needed.
   >
   > It is divided into files that coincide with the `backend controllers` (a.k.a. `endpoints`) for ease of understanding.
4. Helpers
   > This folder is the same as the `constants` folder, but it holds common `methods` and `algorithms` like sorting method.
5. Pages
   > Defines the different `pages` that the system has.
6. Fragments
   > Defines different components that are `specific to a page` and not system wide.
7. App.js
   > Defines different routing in the system.

### Conventions

1. File Naming
   > Components are always saved as `jsx` files.
   >
   > Components are always named in `PascalCase`
